/**
 *
 * This class extends ZmanimCalendar and provides many more *zmanim* than available in the ZmanimCalendar. The basis
 * for most *zmanim* in this class are from the *sefer* **[Yisroel
 * Vehazmanim](https://hebrewbooks.org/9765)** by **[Rabbi Yisrael Dovid Harfenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yisroel_Dovid_Harfenes)**.
 * As an example of the number of different *zmanim* made available by this class, there are methods to return 18
 * different calculations for *alos* (dawn), 18 for *plag hamincha* and 29 for *tzais* available in this
 * API. The real power of this API is the ease in calculating *zmanim* that are not part of the library. The methods for
 * *zmanim* calculations not present in this class or it's superclass  [ZmanimCalendar] are contained in the
 * [AstronomicalCalendar], the base class of the calendars in our API since they are generic methods for calculating
 * time based on degrees or time before or after [sunrise] and [sunset] and are of interest
 * for calculation beyond *zmanim* calculations. Here are some examples.
 *
 * First create the Calendar for the location you would like to calculate:
 *
 * <pre style="background: #FEF0C9; display: inline-block;\">
 * String locationName = &quot;Lakewood, NJ&quot;;
 * double latitude = 40.0828; // Lakewood, NJ
 * double longitude = -74.2094; // Lakewood, NJ
 * double elevation = 20; // optional elevation correction in Meters
 * // the String parameter in timeZone has to be a valid timezone listed in
 * // [java.util.TimeZone.getAvailableIDs]
 * TimeZone timeZone = TimeZone.getTimeZone(&quot;America/New_York&quot;);
 * GeoLocation location = new GeoLocation(locationName, latitude, longitude, elevation, timeZone);
 * ComplexZmanimCalendar czc = new ComplexZmanimCalendar(location);
 * // Optionally set the date or it will default to today's date
 * czc.calendar.set(Calendar.MONTH, Calendar.FEBRUARY);
 * czc.calendar.set(Calendar.DAY_OF_MONTH, 8);</pre>
 *
 *
 * **Note:** For locations such as Israel where the beginning and end of daylight savings time can fluctuate from
 * year to year, if your version of Java does not have an [up to date timezone database](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/tzdata-versions.html), create a
 * [java.util.SimpleTimeZone] with the known start and end of DST.
 * To get *alos* calculated as 14 below the horizon (as calculated in the calendars published in Montreal),
 * add [AstronomicalCalendar.GEOMETRIC_ZENITH] (90) to the 14 offset to get the desired time:
 * <br></br><br></br>
 * <pre style="background: #FEF0C9; display: inline-block;\">
 * Date alos14 = czc.getSunriseOffsetByDegrees([AstronomicalCalendar.GEOMETRIC_ZENITH] + 14);</pre>
 *
 *
 * To get *mincha gedola* calculated based on the [Magen Avraham (MGA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avraham_Gombinern) using a *shaah zmanis* based on the day starting
 * 16.1 below the horizon (and ending 16.1 after sunset) the following calculation can be used:
 *
 * <pre style="background: #FEF0C9; display: inline-block;\">
 * Date minchaGedola = czc.getTimeOffset(czc.getAlos16point1Degrees(), czc.getShaahZmanis16Point1Degrees() * 6.5);</pre>
 *
 *
 * or even simpler using the included convenience methods
 * <pre style="background: #FEF0C9; display: inline-block;\">
 * Date minchaGedola = czc.getMinchaGedola(czc.getAlos16point1Degrees(), czc.getShaahZmanis16Point1Degrees());</pre>
 *
 *
 * A little more complex example would be calculating *zmanim* that rely on a *shaah zmanis* that is
 * not present in this library. While a drop more complex, it is still rather easy. An example would be to calculate
 * the [Trumas Hadeshen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Isserlein)'s *alos* to
 * *tzais* based *plag hamincha* as calculated in the Machzikei Hadass calendar in Manchester, England.
 * A number of this calendar's *zmanim* are calculated based on a day starting at *alos* of 12 before
 * sunrise and ending at *tzais* of 7.083 after sunset. Be aware that since the *alos* and *tzais*
 * do not use identical degree-based offsets, this leads to *chatzos* being at a time other than the
 * [solar transit][sunTransit] (solar midday). To calculate this *zman*, use the following steps. Note
 * that *plag hamincha* is 10.75 hours after the start of the day, and the following steps are all that it takes.
 * <br></br>
 * <pre style="background: #FEF0C9; display: inline-block;\">
 * Date plag = czc.getPlagHamincha(czc.getSunriseOffsetByDegrees([AstronomicalCalendar.GEOMETRIC_ZENITH] + 12),
 * czc.getSunsetOffsetByDegrees([AstronomicalCalendar.GEOMETRIC_ZENITH] + ZENITH_7_POINT_083));</pre>
 *
 *
 * Something a drop more challenging, but still simple, would be calculating a *zman* using the same "complex"
 * offset day used in the above mentioned Manchester calendar, but for a *shaos zmaniyos* based *zman* not
 * supported by this library, such as calculating the point that one should be *makpid*
 * not to eat on *erev Shabbos* or *erev Yom Tov*. This is 9 *shaos zmaniyos* into the day.
 *
 *  1. Calculate the *shaah zmanis* in milliseconds for this day
 *  1. Add 9 of these *shaos zmaniyos* to *alos* starting at 12
 *
 * <br></br>
 * <pre style="background: #FEF0C9; display: inline-block;\">
 * long shaahZmanis = czc.getTemporalHour(czc.getSunriseOffsetByDegrees([AstronomicalCalendar.GEOMETRIC_ZENITH] + 12),
 * czc.getSunsetOffsetByDegrees([AstronomicalCalendar.GEOMETRIC_ZENITH] + ZENITH_7_POINT_083));
 * Date sofZmanAchila = getTimeOffset(czc.getSunriseOffsetByDegrees([AstronomicalCalendar.GEOMETRIC_ZENITH] + 12),
 * shaahZmanis * 9);</pre>
 *
 *
 * Calculating this *sof zman achila* according to the [GRA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vilna_Gaon)
 * is simplicity itself.
 * <pre style="background: #FEF0C9; display: inline-block;\">
 * Date sofZamnAchila = czc.getTimeOffset(czc.getSunrise(), czc.getShaahZmanisGra() * 9);</pre>

 * Hatanya's Seder Hachnasas Shabbos](https://www.chabadlibrary.org/books/pdf/Seder-Hachnosas-Shabbos.pdf). From an elevation of 546 meters, the top of [Har Hacarmel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Carmel), the sun disappears when it is 1 35' or 1.583
     * below the sea level horizon. This in turn is based on the Gemara [Shabbos 35a](https://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=2&daf=35). There are other opinions brought down by
     * Rabbi Levine, including Rabbi Yosef Yitzchok Feigelstock who calculates it as the degrees below the horizon 4 minutes after
     * sunset in Yerushalayim (on the equinox). That is brought down as 1.583. This is identical to the 1 35' *zman*
     * and is probably a typo and should be 1.683. These calculations are used by most [Chabad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chabad) calendars that use the Baal Hatanya's *zmanim*. See
