# BeautifulZmanim
A multi-platform zmanim app that uses Google Material Design, written in Kotlin Multiplatform. Compiles to Android, iOS, web, and desktop (through the JVM). Based on [Sternbach-Software](https://github.com/Sternbach-Software)'s port of [KosherJava](https://github.com/KosherJava/zmanim): [KosherKotlin](https://github.com/Sternbach-Software/KosherKotlin)

## Future 
### Future supported platforms 
 - Android-based flip-phones
 - WearOS
 - watchOS

### Future features
 - Multi-platform way to get location instead of having to type in longitude and latitude
   - Currently, existing libraries only support Android and iOS, not web and desktop:
     - https://github.com/line/abc-kmm-location
     - https://github.com/icerockdev/moko-geo
